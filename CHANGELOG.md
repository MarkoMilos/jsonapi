Change Log
==========

Version 1.0.1 *(2021-02-16)*
----------------------------

* Fix: Corrected "Resource objects" identifier requirement to match the specification. Both `id` and `lid` are now optional to properly conform the MAY part from specification definition: *The id member is not required when the resource object originates at the client and represents a new resource to be created on the server. In that case, a client MAY include a lid member to uniquely identify the resource by type locally within the document.*


Version 1.0.0 *(2021-08-21)*
----------------------------

Initial release.
