# About JSON:API

JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server
should respond to those requests.

JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and
servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability.

# Deviation from specification

- `hreflang` is specified as string or an array of strings indicating the language(s) of the linkâ€™s target. This library
  implements `hreflang` as array of strings only. Deserialization and serialization will work properly since string
  values will be deserialized as array with size 1 and arrays with size equal to 1 will be serialized as string.
